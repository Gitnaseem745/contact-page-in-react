# Contact Page UI in React

This is a Contact Page UI built using React and Tailwind CSS. The main purpose of this project is to understand and implement the `useState` hook in React.

## Project Overview

- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS
- **React Hook Used**: `useState`
- **Project Purpose**: To learn and practice the `useState` hook by dynamically capturing and rendering form field data.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The contact page UI is fully responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS.
- **Dynamic Rendering**: As you fill and submit the form fields, the data will rendered dynamically below the form, showcasing the use of the `useState` hook.
